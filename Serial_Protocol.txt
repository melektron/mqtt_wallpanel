AVR --> ESP
AVR Sends controll commands to ESP.

+++<cmd>;<data1>;<data2>;<data3>;<data4>+

<cmd>:
<cmd> is a placeholder for the command. 
The command tells the ESP what the three data
variables mean.

<datax>:
The tree data tags data1, data2, data3 and data4 are places to 
transfer additional data. Depending on the command these
can be a string as well as a an integer.


All possible commands and data values:

On/Off:
	Sends on or of signal when ON/OFF button is pressed
	<btngroup> is the a number from 0 to 6 defining the ON/OFF/Set button group.
	<state> defines weather the ON or the OFF button is pressed (0 or 1)
	<data3> and <data4> are not used here

	+++p;<btngroup>;<state>;0;0;

Set:
	Sends the color_temp, brightness or color when button is pressed
	<btngroup> is the a number from 0 to 6 defining the ON/OFF/Set button group.
	<type> defines if the brightness color temp or color gets set (b: brightness, t: color_temp, c: color)
	<val> is the raw value of the corresponding potentiometer
	<data4> is not used here

	+++s;<btngroup>;<type>;<val>;0;

Scene:
	Sends scene trigger when scene button is pressed
	<scene> specifies the scene id (depends on which scene button is pressed

	+++z;<scene>;0;0;0;

Raw:
	Sends Raw information if the state of a button or a potentiometer changes.
	Whenever a value is '-' it means this data variable is not used in that
	instance.
	<btn_x> The x coordinate of a button in the button matrix when pressed
	<btn_y> The y coordinate of a button in the button matrix when pressed
	<pot_nr> id of the potentiometer that has changed its state
	<pot_val> the value of the potentiometer that has changed its state 
	+++r;<btn_x>;<btn_y>;<pot_nr>;<pot_val>;
